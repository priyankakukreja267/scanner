<a name="ckp-completed"><h3>Completed work</h3></a>
<p>So far we have focused on getting a working version of our project and some example data and tasks to test it. We&rsquo;ve set up a basic but modular and extensible architecture for our system using tensorflow and reusing the basic paradigms of Scanner. This includes a database module that supports video and data columns and where videos are represented by tables, as well as an interface for defining stateful kernels and computation graphs with these kernels.</p>
<p>We have also collected a few gigabytes of video to test the system on, and written some simple kernels (like a brightness adjuster).</p>

<a name="ckp-deliverables"><h3>Update on goal and deliverables</h3></a>
<p>We have modified the scope of the project somewhat since the proposal. We no longer plan to replace parts of the original Scanner system with Tensorflow implementations; instead, we are trying to build a simplified version of Scanner using Tensorflow from scratch. We have essentially moved from a partial reimplementation to a relatively full-featured technology demonstrator. We feel like this change will make it easier for us to reach our goal of evaluating Tensorflow as a platform on top of which to build a system like Scanner, since it cuts the time required to familiarize ourselves with a complex system and modify many interdependent parts to add Tensorflow code to it.</p>
<p>Taking these changes into account, we are on time according to the schedule we laid out in the proposal. Some of our nice-to-haves, relating to the database essentially, have also moved into the main scope because of these changes.</p>
<p>We consider it would be nice to add the possibility to do parallel video encoding and decoding, since it seems to be a bottleneck of our current system. Another nice addition would be adding real-time video processing capabilities.</p>

<a name="ckp-presentation"><h3>Competition presentation</h3></a>
<p>We plan to demonstrate the performance of tScanner (implemented using TensorFlow) compared to the original implementation of Scanner. This analysis will focus on bottlenecks and fundamental limitations, since we do not have the time or resources to fine-tune our system as much as Scanner, and we are using some less-optimized libraries and kernels.</p>

<a name="ckp-results"><h3>Preliminary results</h3></a>
<p>At this time, we are able to run simple kernels (histogram, brightness change) on a collection of videos, and arrange computations in a graph. We have not performed rigorous benchmarking.</p>

<a name="ckp-issues"><h3>Most concerning issues</h3></a>
<p>Ideally, we&rsquo;d like there to be a way to pipeline operations perfectly: if two stages of the pipeline use different resources (like CPU and GPU) or do not use their resource in full, we&rsquo;d like these stages to run in parallel with two consecutive packets/frames. This seems possible using batching, but that would sacrifice some granularity. There seems to be no conceptual problem with this, but we&rsquo;re not sure if there&rsquo;s a good way to do it using Tensorflow.</p>

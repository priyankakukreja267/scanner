<a name="ckp-completed"><h3>Completed work</h3></a>
<p>So far we have focused on getting a working version of our project and some example data and tasks to test it. We&rsquo;ve set up a basic but modular and extensible architecture for our system using tensorflow and reusing the basic paradigms of Scanner. This includes a database module that supports video and data columns and where videos are represented by tables, as well as an interface for defining stateful kernels and computation graphs with these kernels.</p>
<p>We have also collected a few gigabytes of video to test the system on, and written some simple kernels (like a brightness adjuster).</p>

<a name="ckp-deliverables"><h3>Update on goal and deliverables</h3></a>
<p>We have modified the scope of the project somewhat since the proposal. We no longer plan to replace parts of the original Scanner system with Tensorflow implementations; instead, we are trying to build a simplified version of Scanner using Tensorflow from scratch. We have essentially moved from a partial reimplementation to a relatively full-featured technology demonstrator. We feel like this change will make it easier for us to reach our goal of evaluating Tensorflow as a platform on top of which to build a system like Scanner, since it cuts the time required to familiarize ourselves with a complex system and modify many interdependent parts to add Tensorflow code to it.</p>
<p>Taking these changes into account, we are on time according to the schedule we laid out in the proposal. Some of our nice-to-haves, relating to the database essentially, have also moved into the main scope because of these changes.</p>
<p>We consider it would be nice to add the possibility to do parallel video encoding and decoding, since it seems to be a bottleneck of our current system. Another nice addition would be adding real-time video processing capabilities.</p>

<a name="ckp-presentation"><h3>Competition presentation</h3></a>
<p>We plan to demonstrate the performance of tScanner (implemented using TensorFlow) compared to the original implementation of Scanner. This analysis will focus on bottlenecks and fundamental limitations, since we do not have the time or resources to fine-tune our system as much as Scanner, and we are using some less-optimized libraries and kernels.</p>

<a name="ckp-results"><h3>Preliminary results</h3></a>
<p>At this time, we are able to run simple kernels (histogram, brightness change) on a collection of videos, and arrange computations in a graph. We have not performed rigorous benchmarking.</p>

<a name="ckp-issues"><h3>Most concerning issues</h3></a>
<p>Ideally, we&rsquo;d like there to be a way to pipeline operations perfectly: if two stages of the pipeline use different resources (like CPU and GPU) or do not use their resource in full, we&rsquo;d like these stages to run in parallel with two consecutive packets/frames. This seems possible using batching, but that would sacrifice some granularity. There seems to be no conceptual problem with this, but we&rsquo;re not sure if there&rsquo;s a good way to do it using Tensorflow.</p>


<a name="proposal"><h2>Proposal</h2></a>
<a name="summary"><h3>Summary</h3></a>
<p>Scanner is a framework that facilitates running complex pipelines or computation graphs on compressed videos across a heterogeneous processing environment. The idea of this project is to determine if Scanner&rsquo;s performance can be improved by replacing its scheduler with a TensorFlow graph generator, and letting TensorFlow orchestrate computation.</p>

<a name="background"><h3>Background</h3></a>
<p>Scanner is a platform for large scale video analytics. It specializes in visual computing by efficiently managing compressed video data sets and performing computations on heterogeneous clusters (CPUs, GPUs and ASICs for video encoding and decoding). Scanner makes it easy to use computer vision and pixel processing tools. It does this by representing computation as a dataflow graph where each node represents a function and the edges represent the data flowing between different functions. Scanner takes these dataflow graphs and executes them on a cluster of machines, loading videos from and saving results to Scanner DB. TensorFlow is heavily optimized and also uses a DAG to represent its computations, so it&rsquo;s natural to wonder if we can implement Scanner using TensorFlow. </p>

<a name="challenges"><h3>Challenges</h3></a>
<ul>
<li>Optimal task scheduling for minimal synchronization overhead and maximal scalability in a heterogeneous environment.</li>
<li>Using TensorFlow to handle workloads different than its typical machine learning applications. This allows utilizing the best kernel implementation available to the application.</li>
<li>Working with compressed video requires on-the-fly decoding of frames to limit storage costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>For testing and benchmarking, we will need access to machines with GPUs or high CPU counts, and ideally a cluster of machines.</p>

<a name="gad"><h3>Goals and Deliverables</h3></a>
<h4>Plan to achieve</h4>
<ul>
<li>Define a mapping between the existing kernel interface and the TensorFlow kernel interface, including stateful kernels that can be reset. </li>
<li>Automatically instantiate multiple TensorFlow DAGs across a cluster </li>
<li>Demonstrate better performance in Scanner-TensorFlow than vanilla Scanner, or give a precise analysis of reasons that lead us to think this cannot be achieved.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hope to achieve</h4>
<ul>
<li>Implement database IO functionality using TensorFlow to feed data from the existing database format into TensorFlow DAG in a streaming fashion</li>
<li>Support the sampling primitives in the existing Scanner (stride, gather, join) to select rows from the databases </li>
<li>Use TensorFlow for storing the output of a pipeline into the Scanner DB.</li>
<li>If our TensorFlow implementation cannot match the speed of the existing Scanner implementation, specify precise improvements that could be made to TensorFlow in order to alleviate the issues we found.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deliverables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Live demo of face detection using KrishnaCam</li>
<li>Graphs of speedup obtained (if any) over the vanilla Scanner implementation</li>
</ul>

<a name="platform"><h3>Platform choice</h3></a>
<p>This project is essentially about a change of platform. We think TensorFlow is an appropriate framework in which to tackle the challenges Scanner is facing since its core is a powerful and versatile execution engine. TensorFlow is one of the fastest frameworks available for the tasks for which it is commonly used.</p>

<a name="schedule"><h3>Schedule</h3></a>
<p>Week 1</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up the environment: get Scanner and TensorFlow working on our machines</li>
<li>Run a simple Scanner kernel in a one-stage TensorFlow pipeline</li>
<li>Start converting the Scanner scheduler into a TensorFlow graph builder (no distribution across several nodes yet)</li>
</ul>
<p>Week 2</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish work on converting the scheduler to a TensorFlow graph builder</li>
</ul>
<p>Week 3</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for running the TensorFlow computations across several nodes in a cluster.</li>
<li>Interface TensorFlow computations with the Scanner database system.</li>
</ul>

<li>Benchmark our system against vanilla Scanner on different types of workloads and hardware. Analyze the performance of our TensorFlow-based system</li>
<li>Prepare the final website and presentation.</li>
